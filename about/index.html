  <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I've been wanting to work on my own projects, but getting stuck and not having someone to help me out of the rut is one of my biggest fears. Self-doubt and criticism raised questions and paralyzed me from ever even taking the first step in this direction. <i>"What would I do if I get stuck?"</i>    
<i>"What if I'm not good enough?"</i>, <i>"What if I realize I am a failure after I start?"</i> </p>
    <p>The battle with the imposter syndrome was even more difficult during the major months of the COVID-19 pandemic (May to August, 2020).
  The <i>want</i> was there, but the <i>willpower</i> to execute it, was nowhere to be found. </p>
   <p> I decided to make it a personal project to learn how to set up github pages to potentially pass on my knowledge and teach the public about it via my workplace.
     So, here is me taking my fears by its horn and giving it a go! </p>
    <p> If you are like me, and struggle with getting things done for yourself, try to change your vision and see how you can get that thing done, not just for yourself, but also to help others who may need your help!</p>
